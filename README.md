# Bubble Sort

My implementation of bubble sort in Ruby

bubble_sort.rb = #bubble_sort takes an array and returns a sorted array. It uses the bubble sort methodology

bubble_sort_by.rb = #bubble_sort_by takes an array and returns a sorted array. The block will have two arguments that represent the two elements of the array that are currently being compared. It uses the blockâ€™s return value to sort the array
